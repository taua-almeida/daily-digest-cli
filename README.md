# ðŸš€ Welcome to `gh-digest` - Your Daily GitHub Activity Tracker!

Hey there! Tired of juggling between countless tabs to keep track of your GitHub pull requests? Say no more! `gh-digest` to the rescue! This tool is your personal GitHub, looking through repositories to bring you a neatly compiled daily digest of your GitHub activities. Stay updated with your pending reviews, PR statuses, and more, with just a few clicks (or typing - I expect you to do it)

## ðŸ§° Built with Go and Some Awesome Packages

`gh-digest` is crafted using the power of Go, and it employs some fantastic packages to keep things smooth and efficient:

- Cobra: For that sleek command-line interface.
- go-github/v56: Fetching data from GitHub without this is like trying to eat soup with a fork.
- BurntSushi/toml: Because who doesn't love a well-structured config file? And why toml and not json, or yml, or txt? Well why not?
